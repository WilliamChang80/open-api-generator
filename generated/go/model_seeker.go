// Seek sets the offset for the next Read or Write to offset, interpreted according to whence: SeekStart means relative to the start of the file, SeekCurrent means relative to the current offset, and SeekEnd means relative to the end (for example, offset = -2 specifies the penultimate byte of the file). Seek returns the new offset relative to the start of the file or an error, if any.  Seeking to an offset before the start of the file is an error. Seeking to any positive offset may be allowed, but if the new offset exceeds the size of the underlying object the behavior of subsequent I/O operations is implementation-dependent.
